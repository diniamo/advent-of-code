# My Advent of Code repo
These are my implementation of the Advent of Code tasks (which I could do at the time).

# How to run
1. Create a session_id.txt with your session id in it (you can get it from inspect element)
2. Open IntelliJ and press run in my aoc.kt main function,
   or type `gradle run` in the comand line.

# What's Advent of Code?
